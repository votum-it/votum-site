        challenge:'Водещ автомобилен производител се бореше с фрагментирани инструменти, ограничена видимост и непоследователни процеси в глобалните екипи. След мащабна трансформация се нуждаеше от надежден дългосрочен партньор за управление, поддръжка и непрекъснато подобрение на централизираната си платформа за доставка на софтуер и тестване.',

На тази основа предоставяме end-to-end управлявани услуги за платформа, поддържаща над 1 000 потребители по целия свят, включително поддръжка на системата, потребителска поддръжка L1–L2, управление на инциденти и непрекъснати подобрения на платформата.',

Всички прикачени файлове и документи бяха извлечени и структурирани за запазване на техните взаимовръзки. Разработихме също и персонализиран инструмент за достъп за одит и съответствие.',
